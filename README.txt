This repository was created as the final project for the Aygaz Machine Learning Bootcamp program organized by Global AI Hub. We built a price prediction model using the Melbourne House Price dataset available on Kaggle.

The dataset and the business problem used in the project are related to a regression problem. Therefore, regression models were employed, and the accuracy scores of these models were compared. The models we used include:

- Lasso
- LinearRegression
- Ridge
- ElasticNet
- KNeighborsRegressor
- RandomForestRegressor
- GradientBoostingRegressor
- AdaBoostRegressor 

The evaluation metrics used to assess model accuracy are:

- Mean Absolute Error
- Mean Squared Error
- Root Mean Squared Error
- R-squared (R2)
